chat-proxy
==========
Proxy server for IRC and stuff 

#Description
I have been using irssi as my IRC client or the last 10 years or so and since
i'm always looking to improve my skills i want to give node.js a go...

#Purpose
The purpose of this service will be to connect to IRC servers and provide 
me with a webinterface that uses websockets to refresh my browserscreen.

Just like i'm able to detach and attach my screen session containing irssi, i
should be able to disconnect my browser session, and when reconnecting i should get
all channel and privatemsg history.

#Additional challenge
Instead of going all crazy on this for a few nights i want to achieve a 100 days in a row
git commit streak on github.

#How to install?
git clone https://github.com/MrSam/chat-proxy
npm install
node server.js
